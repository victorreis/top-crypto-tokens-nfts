## Introduction

A simple and intuitive React TypeScript template.
The main objective of this project is to practice some development skills through some technologies and concepts:

- ReactJS
- React Hooks
- TypeScript
- CSS-in-JS (styled-components)
- Unity tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Linters (eslint, style-lint, lint-staged)
- Formatters (editorconfig, prettier)
- git hooks (husky: pre-commit, prepare-commit-message)
- conventional-commits (commitizen)
- Scaffolding (scaffdog)
- Environment config (.vscode/\*, .npmrc)
- Thematization
- Usability
- Responsivity
- Clean Code
- SOLID
- KISS: “Keep It Simple, Stupid!”
- YAGNI: “You Ain’t gonna need it”
- DRY: “Do not Repeat Yourself”

## Features

## Bonus features and implementations

- Friendly messages to show the user some success/error status.
- High level of quality (strong eslint/typescript rules, scaffolding, separation of responsibilities, tests, pre-commit with type-check/linting/tests etc).
- Create a lot of components through the styled-components with a well organized structure of files (instead of using third part libraries).
- Unity tests in the component styles, behaviors, snapshots etc.
- Global tests configuration that provides a simple and standardized way to render the components through the React Testing Renderer or through React Testing Library, with the theme provider already embedded.
- Create a thematization structure that allows you to create how many themes that you want.
- Create a customized theme interface with some structures implemented (borders, colors and typography).
- Implements responsiveness to allow any screen size by using @media queries and the Grid Layout.
- Usage of React Context, React Hooks.
- Usage of Typescript generics, union type and interface manipulation and interesting Type utilities.
